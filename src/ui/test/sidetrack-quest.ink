-Last summer, we decided to try something new - All the students here, at The Academy, had to build a game.
# character: ada
-Each student needed to own the project and manage it themselves, but they could ask anyone around The Academy for help.
# character: ada
-You've probably guessed whose project this is already - our star student, Riley!
# character: riley
-Oh, jeez... I didn't do everything, I mean, Ada helped with design, and Saniel helped me with the code, and Felix--
# character: faber
-Don't sell yourself short, Riley! It takes a lot of skill and talent to put something like this together.
# character: saniel
-Let's dim the lights, shall we? Riley, the room is yours.
# character: riley
-Woohoo! Here we are! See that <b>Exit</b> on the far side of the screen? That's our goal! Let's get there! Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN <b>Instructions</b> to move through these obstacles, but watch out for those <b>Walls</b>!

- Nice job on the music, Riley. Looks like all our jam sessions paid off!

# character: saniel
-Oh ho! <b>Pits</b>, eh? I wonder how you'll cross those...
# character: riley
-You need to use the <b>Jump</b> instruction to cross <b>Pits</b>! There's a trick to it, though. <b>Jump</b> can only cross a <b>pit</b> if it's <b>directly</b> in front of you.

-Hey Riley, I think your game has some <b>bugs</b>, LOL! What a cool bunch of robots. `Beep. Boop. Hello. Faber. I. Am. A. Bugbot.`
# character: riley
-I knew you'd like that one, Faber :D
# character: estelle
-Stay alert, {get_user_name()}! The bugbots move when you do, so you'll have to plan out your moves carefully.
-Watch how the bugbots move and where they go, and think about the spaces they open up when they move.
# character: riley
-These bugbots <b>only move down</b>, never left or right, so that might let you find a... bug... in their behavior.
Oh, and when they walk off the bottom, they reappear at the top! So keep your eye out for that!

-What was <b>that</b>? Riley?
# character: ada
-I think we have a problem! Riley, it looks like the manual controls for your maze just disappeared. Any ideas?
# character: riley
-I was wondering when Felix would show up. For once, he's on time and doing exactly what I asked him to. <b>Now</b> things are going to get interesting!
# character: estelle
-Look, {get_user_name()} - there's a pre-made set of instructions already here.
# character: riley
-And now, we enter hard-mode! See that <b>Play</b> button? Try pushing it.

-In this mode, we can still move around the level, but you'll have to plan all your moves in advance. Just think it through, and you'll pass these levels in no time.
Once your instructions are laid out in the order you want them, press <b>play</b> to start our journey through the maze.

-Hmm, there's just no way this set of instructions could finish this level. You'll have to re-order them.

-Drag and drop instructions to re-order them, and press <b>Play</b> to start your run! Oh yeah, and once you press play... no changing instructions around until you succeed or fail!

-Fantastic work, you practically sailed through that level, {get_user_name()}. Excellent planning! Riley - I can see the progression from puzzle-solving to strategic planning in this game, and I'm impressed.

Woah. T-thanks, Saniel! That really means a lot to me.

-Hey Riley, how's your maze going?

-It's pretty... a-maze-ing! :D Seriously, {get_user_name()} I hope you're having as much fun as we are. It's so cool to see someone play something I helped build!
# characte: ada
-Ah hah, look at your instructions carefully. You've only got one jump, so use it well - you might need other ways of getting around the pits.

# character: riley
-Let's turn the heat up - now you've got 2 Jumps.
# character: ada
-It might look easier, but now you only have a single forward instruction. Think carefully about where you might need it.
-I'm pretty sure there's only one spot in this level that you absolutely <b>must</b> move forward, and not down or up. Can you find it?
+ [(wait for: currentLevel is 20)] (Level Complete!)

=== level20 ===
# character: faber
I'd say something about this level bringing me <b>down</b>, but this game is too cool for that. How are you supposed to move forward when all you can do is go down, though? Might as well give it a shot!
+ [(wait for: currentLevel is 21)] (Level Complete!)

=== level21 ===
# character: ada
-You know, you don't have to have a pit in front of you to use a jump instruction. Maybe you could use jump to go forward? You never know when that will come in handy!

-Interesting, I wonder what happens if we just press Play and try to forge ahead?

# character: saniel
- Well, at least we've proved that there's clearly an error. Weâ€™ll need to see the code to debug it, though.
# character: ada
Yes, I see where this is going - I think we've reached a good point to take a break, I'm sure we could all use it.
# character: faber
Congrats, Riley - This is an awesome project you've pulled together. We'll meet back up here later to keep going, and debug that broken instruction. See you in the next activity!
